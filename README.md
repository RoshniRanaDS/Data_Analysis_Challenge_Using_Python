# Python for Financial Analysis and Election results Analysis

# Analysis Background
The world of programming with Python. 
In this assignment, have used the concepts i have learned to complete two Python challenges, 
PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

# Repo Introduction
Inside my local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.
In each folder, have created, added the following content:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A Resources folder that contains the CSV files i have used. Made sure that my script has the correct path to the CSV file.
An analysis folder that contains text file that has the results from each analysis.
Pushed these changes to GitHub profile by bash terminal.
